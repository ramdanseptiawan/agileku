# File Upload Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive file upload feature implementation for the LMS system, integrating frontend components with backend APIs.

## Backend Implementation

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/protected/uploads/file` - Upload file
- `GET /api/protected/uploads/file/{id}` - Download file by ID
- `POST /api/protected/submissions/postwork` - Create post-work submission
- `GET /api/protected/submissions/postwork/{courseId}` - Get post-work submissions
- `POST /api/protected/submissions/finalproject` - Create final project submission
- `GET /api/protected/submissions/finalproject/{courseId}` - Get final project submission

### Database Models
- `FileUpload` - Stores file metadata and content
- `PostWorkSubmission` - Links post-work submissions to files
- `FinalProjectSubmission` - Links final project submissions to files

### File Handling
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Multipart form data parsing
- File validation and storage
- Secure file retrieval

## Frontend Implementation

### API Service (`src/services/api.js`)
Added `submissionAPI` object with methods:
- `uploadFile(file)` - Upload file with validation
